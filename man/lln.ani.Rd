\description{Demonstration of Law of Large Numbers
This function plots the sample mean as the sample size grows to check
whether the sample mean approaches to the population mean.}
\details{\code{np} points are plotted to denote the distribution of the sample mean;
we will observe that the range of the sample mean just becomes smaller and
smaller as the sample size increases and ultimately there will be an
obvious trend that the sample mean converges to the population mean
\code{mu}.

The parameter \code{nmax} in \code{\link{ani.options}} means the maximum
sample size.}
\value{None (invisible `\code{NULL}').}
\note{The argument \code{pch} will influence the speed of plotting, and for
a very large sample size (say, 300), it is suggested that this argument
be specified as '\code{.}'.}
