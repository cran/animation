		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-1


NEW FEATURES

    o A news-reading function ani.news() added so that changes will
  be conveniently known.
    o boot.iid() is available for demonstration of bootstrapping 
  i.i.d data. 


MINOR CHANGES 

    o The arguments ... is added in animation functions to control
  PNG image files. 
    o The sample data is permuted before cv.ani() so that every time
  we do cross-validation, the splitting of trainig set and test set
  will change (instead of splitting 1:n into k parts). The tick 
  marks of x-axis will change accordingly.
