This package contains various functions for animations in
statistics, covering many areas such as probability theory, mathematical
statistics, multivariate statistics, nonparametric statistics, sampling
survey, linear models, time series, computational statistics, data mining
and machine learning. These functions might be of help in teaching
statistics and data analysis. Also provided in this package are several
approaches to save animations to various formats, e.g. Flash, GIF, HTML
page and PDF.
