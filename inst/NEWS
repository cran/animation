		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-2


NEW FEATURES

    o A new function bagging.tree() to illustrate the process of 
  bagging classification trees is to be added (sorry it's not
  available yet). 

MINOR CHANGES 

    o An argument 'col' added to flip.coin() to control colors of 
  each face of the coin. 
    o The 'pageview' data updated to Dec 3, 2007.
    o Points that have already been classified in knn.ani() are
  marked out in later steps of classification for the rest points.
    o The values of PI are silently returned in buffon.needle().
    o The result for the test set can be returned in knn.ani(). 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The computation for kfcv() is changed so that the sample
  sizes will be more 'uniformly' allocated.
    o A new function ani.control() added so that the controlling
  parameters can be more uniform and the scalability of the
  animation functions will also be better. All the animation 
  functions are chanaged accordingly.

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-1


NEW FEATURES

    o A news-reading function ani.news() added so that changes will
  be conveniently known.
    o boot.iid() is available for demonstration of bootstrapping 
  i.i.d data. 


MINOR CHANGES 

    o The arguments ... is added in animation functions to control
  PNG image files. 
    o The sample data is permuted before cv.ani() so that every time
  we do cross-validation, the splitting of trainig set and test set
  will change (instead of splitting 1:n into k parts). The tick 
  marks of x-axis will change accordingly.

    CONSTITUTION OF animation VERSION 0.1-0 
    
    o ani.start() to start an HTML page for animations.
    o ani.stop() to complete the HTML animation page.
    o brownian.motion() to demonstrate Brownian motion in the 2D 
  plane. 
    o buffon.needle() to simulate the process of Buffon's needle.
    o cv.ani() to demonstrate k-fold cross validation.
    o flip.coin() to simulate tossing 'coins'.
    o kfcv() to compute sample sizes for k-fold cross-validation.
    o kmeans.ani() to show the process of K-Means cluster analysis.
    o knn.ani() to show k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
    o savePNG() to save PNG image files which constitute the basic
  animation frames in the HTML page.
    o tidy.source() is a trivial function to 'tidy up' R code 
  using the internal R function parse(). 
    o 'pageview' is a daily page view data of my personal website.
